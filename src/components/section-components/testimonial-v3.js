										<p>I will be a lawyer, all thanks to BMBC, which just cleared my CLAT. I have wanted to be a lawyer since I could remember. I did everything in my life to achieve this goal, and my best decision was to sign up on the BMBC website. It helped me find a great place to learn and was affordable.</p>

										<p>I recently cleared my SSC CGL, with great thanks to the BMBC. The tuition fee was too high at most institutes, but through the BMBC portal, I could find a place with a reasonable price structure for their courses. I had great difficulty conversing and writing in English, but the teachers were patient, and extra classes helped me improve, and I'm still learning and getting better every day. </p>

										<p>I had been to many institutes but couldnâ€™t fit in any place; sometimes, it was too far, and sometimes, it was too costly. I was tired of all the searching, but BMBC was where I found the best institute near me that could make me understand concepts very easily. BMBC came at a time when I needed it the most.</p>

										<p>I cleared BITSAT, all thanks to BMBC for finding me the best place to learn. Since the day I came here, I had set my goals on JEE, but through BMBC, I realised I had many options, such as BITSAT. I worked hard for JEE but got a better rank in BITSAT, and I am very happy that I could get an engineering degree from this university.</p>

										<p>I cleared my NEET exams. As my school teacher would say, I was not a very bright student, but my parents believed in me and sent me to an institute they found on BMBC when I was in the 11th standard. I enjoyed my time learning new things in chemistry and biology. </p>
